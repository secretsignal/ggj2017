Huge thank you to Mahdi Dibaiee for sharing his original node-games project.

This is a dirty hack of his excellent node-games project.
If this game catches anyone's attention I recommend checking out his project: https://github.com/mdibaiee/node-games

## Notes
This works for me, on my mac, using both iterm 2 and terminal.
This will _probably_ not work on windows.
Possibly will work on linux.

Good luck!

## To Install:

1.  Open TERMINAL
2.  `npm install -g terminal-shark`
3.  run `terminal-shark`
4.  have fun!
